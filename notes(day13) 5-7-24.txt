On importing any module, whatever the code is written in that module will run.

The if __name__ == "__main__" idiom is a common pattern used in Python scripts to determine whether the script is being run directly or being imported as a module into another script.

In Python, the __name__ variable is a built-in variable that is automatically set to the name of the current module. When a Python script is run directly, the __name__ variable is set to the string __main__ When the script is imported as a module into another script, the __name__ variable is set to the name of the module.

-->It is to be used when we will import the module in another file.

os module - The os module in Python is a built-in library that provides functions for interacting with the operating system. It allows you to perform a wide variety of tasks, such as reading and writing files, interacting with the file system, and running system commands.
-->Os module is too vast but some functions which are very basic and should be learnt are:-
1. os.mkdir("") - it is used to make a new directory(Folder)
-->To make a file - os.mkdir("directory/NameOfFile")
2. os.listdir("") - gives a list of all the folders in the directory
3. (os.listdir(f"data/{folder}")) - gives a list of files present in that directory
4. os.rename(f"data/Tutorial{i+1}", f"data/Tutorial {i+1}") - renames the folder (current name,  new name)
5. os.getcwd() - tells in which directory we are currently working in.
6. os.chdir() - if we want to access a directory.

Variable - A variable is a named location in memory that stores a value. In Python, we can assign values to variables using the assignment operator.

Local variable - A local variable is a variable that is defined within a function and is only accessible within that function. It is created when the function is called and is destroyed when the function returns.

Global variable - a global variable is a variable that is defined outside of a function and is accessible from within any function in your code.

Global keyword - The global keyword is used to declare that a variable is a global variable and should be accessed from the global scope.

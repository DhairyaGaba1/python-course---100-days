Typecasting - Conversion of one data type into another data type.
Following can be used for typecasting - int(), float(), str(), ord(), hex(), oct(), tuple(), set(), list(), dict().
Types of typecasting:
1 - Implicit typecasting - It is done by python itself.
2 - Explicit typecasting - It is done by the developer(smaller datatype to higher datatype to prevent data loss).

input() - It is used to take input from the user.
-->Python takes input as string, to convert it into a number we use int()/float() which is known as typecasting.

Strings - Anything enclosed between double/single quotes.
Multiline strings - Can be done by using '''.
Indexing of strings - String is like an array of characters and the indexing starts from 0 and goes upto (number of characters in string - 1).

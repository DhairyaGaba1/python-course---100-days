List methods:-

1. append() - it is used to add element in the list(it is added to the end of the list).
2. sort() - It sorts the list in ascending order.
-->if we use reverse=True then we get descending order.
3. reverse() - Reverse the order of the list.
4. index() - returns of index of the first occurence of the given item.
5. count() - tells the number of occurences of the given item.
6. copy() -  returns copy of the list. This can be done to perform operations of the list without modifying it.
7. insert() - it is used to insert element in the list at certain index number.
--> syntax - list.insert(index_no,"item")
8. extend() - used to insert list or any other collection data type(set, tuple, dictionary) to the existing list.
9. concatenating the two lists - it is done by adding + symbol between two lists.

Tuples - They are same as list the only difference is that they are immutable.
-->Its indexing is same as list and has both positive and negative indexing.
-->We can check for item in it by using the keyword 'in'.
-->Slicing can be done in tuple using same method in list.
-> tuplename[start:end:gaps]
-> We get a new tuple when we do tuple slicing.

Tuple methods:-

1. Manipulating a tuple - It cannot be done directly,  to do so we need to first convert it into a list add an item and then convert it into tupple again.
--> We can create a new tuple by concatenating them as a new tuple will be formed.
2. count() - tells the number of occurences of the given element.
3. index() - returns the index of the first occurence of the given element.
->tuple.index(element, start, end) - first slicing then it checks the occurence of the element.
4. len() - returns the length of the tuple.

Exercise 3 - Create a program capable of displaying questions to the user like KBC - Pending.
